visionOS
Overview
visionOS is the operating system that powers Vision Pro. Use visionOS together with familiar tools and technologies to build immersive apps and games for spatial computing.

"Create new apps using SwiftUI to take full advantage of the spectrum of immersion available in visionOS. If you have an existing iPad or iPhone app, add the visionOS destination to your app’s target to gain access to the standard system appearance, and add platform-specific features to create a compelling experience. To provide continuous access to your content in the meantime, deliver a compatible version of your app that runs in visionOS."
Expand your app into immersive spaces
"Start with a familiar window-based experience to introduce people to your content. From there, add SwiftUI scene types specific to visionOS, such as volumes and spaces. These scene types let you incorporate depth, 3D objects, and immersive experiences."
"Build your app’s 3D content with RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro, and display it with a RealityView. In an immersive experience, use ARKit to integrate your content with the person’s surroundings."

Explore new kinds of interaction
"People can select an element by looking at it and tapping their fingers together. They can also pinch, drag, zoom, and rotate objects using specific hand gestures. SwiftUI provides built-in support for these standard gestures, so rely on them for most of your app’s input. When you want to go beyond the standard gestures, use ARKit to create custom gestures."
