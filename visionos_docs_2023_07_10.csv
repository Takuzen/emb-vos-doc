"Creating your first visionOS app  Overview See Also       Create your Xcode project Modify the existing window Handle events in your views Build and run your app App construction                        If you’re new to visionOS, start with a new Xcode project to learn about the platform features, and to familiarize yourself with visionOS content and techniques. When you build an app for visionOS, SwiftUI is an excellent choice because it gives you full access to visionOS features. Although you can also use UIKit to build portions of your app, you need to use SwiftUI for many features that are unique to the platform. In any SwiftUI app, you place content onscreen using scenes. A scene contains the views and controls to display onscreen. Scenes also define the appearance of those views and controls when they appear onscreen. In visionOS, you can include both 2D and 3D views in the same scene, and you can present those views in a window or as part of the person’s surroundings. Scene with a window Scene with a window and 3D objects Start with a new Xcode project and add features to familiarize yourself with visionOS content and techniques. Run your app in Simulator to verify your content looks like you expect, and run it on device to see your 3D content come to life. Organize your content around one or more scenes, which manage your app’s interface. Each scene contains the views and controls you want to display, and the scene type determines whether your content adopts a 2D or 3D appearance. SwiftUI adds 3D scene types specifically for visionOS, and also adds 3D elements and layout options for all scene types. Create a new project in Xcode by choosing File > New > Project. Navigate to the visionOS section of the template chooser, and choose the App template. When prompted, specify a name for your project along with other options. When creating a new visionOS app, you can configure your app’s initial scene types from the configuration dialog. To display primarily 2D content in your initial scene, choose a Window as your initial scene type. For primarily 3D content, choose a Volume. You can also add an immersive scene to place your content in the person’s surroundings.  Include a Reality Composer Pro project file when you want to create 3D assets or scenes to display from your app. Use this project file to build content from primitive shapes and existing USDZ assets. You can also use it to build and test custom RealityKit animations and behaviors for your content. Build your initial interface using standard SwiftUI views. Views provide the basic content for your interface, and you customize the appearance and behavior of them using SwiftUI modifiers. For example, the .background modifier adds a partially transparent tint color behind your content: To learn more about how to create and configure interfaces using SwiftUI, see SwiftUI Essentials. Many SwiftUI views handle interactions automatically — all you do is provide code to run when the interactions occur. You can also add SwiftUI gesture recognizers to a view to handle tap, long-press, drag, rotate, and zoom gestures. The system automatically maps the following types of input to your SwiftUI event-handling code:  Indirect input. The person’s eyes indicate the target of an interaction. To start the interaction, the person touches their thumb and forefinger together on one or both hands. Additional finger and hand movements define the gesture type.  Direct input. When a person’s finger occupies the same space as an onscreen item, the system reports an interaction. Additional finger and hand movements define the gesture type.  Keyboard input. People can use a connected mouse, trackpad, or keyboard to interact with items, trigger menu commands, and perform gestures. For more information about handling interactions in SwiftUI views, see Handling User Input in the SwiftUI Essentials tutorial. Build and run your app in Simulator to see how it looks. Simulator for visionOS has a virtual background as the backdrop for your app’s content. Use your keyboard and your mouse or trackpad to navigate around the environment and interact with your app. Tap and drag the window bar below your app’s content to reposition the window in the environment. Move the pointer over the circle next to the window bar to reveal the window’s close button. Move the cursor to one of the window’s corners to turn the window bar into a resizing control. Note Apps don’t control the placement of windows in the space. The system places each window in its initial position, and updates that position based on further interactions with the app. For additional information about how to interact with your app in Simulator, see Interacting with your app in the visionOS simulator.       .background @main

Use simulated devices to debug your app on a variety of hardware to which you don’t have immediate access. The tradeoff is that simulated devices run within the Simulator app on your Mac and don’t replicate the performance or features of an actual device. To verify your app runs exactly as intended, run it on one or more real devices. You can connect a real device to your Mac using a cable, or for iOS, tvOS, or visionOS apps, connect it over Wi-Fi after you pair it with Xcode. SwiftUI previews let you see your app’s interface without building and running your app. For more information on these dynamic previews, see Previews in Xcode. Before you build and run your app, select a build scheme that includes the target for your app. A scheme is a collection of project details and settings that tell Xcode how to build and run a product from your project. Xcode determines where the resulting product can run based on the scheme you select, and populates the run destination menu in the toolbar with the list of available devices. For example, if the scheme contains a tvOS app, Xcode includes only tvOS simulators and devices as potential run destinations. To learn more about schemes, see Customizing the build schemes for a project. Important When running apps in Simulator, some hardware-specific features might not be available. Frameworks that provide access to device-specific features also provide API to tell you when those features are available. Call those APIs and handle the case where a feature isn’t available. To test the feature itself, run your code on a real device. Manage real and simulated devices in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode. To view this window, choose Window > Devices and Simulators. View and configure simulated devices from the Simulators tab.  To add a new simulated device, click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the list of simulators and specify the configuration you want. You can add new simulators to specify a different device type or operating system version than the default set. To remove a simulator from the list, select it and press Delete. Note Xcode requires the Simulator runtime for each platform and system version for which you build and run Simulator. If Xcode doesn’t display device types for a platform, you might need to install that platform’s Simulator runtime. For more information on this installation, see Installing and managing Simulator runtimes. To view and manage connections to your real devices, choose the Devices tab in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode. The Devices tab shows the currently connected and disconnected devices and can help you diagnose problems that might occur. For example, Xcode might show a device as unavailable if it’s not running an operating system version your app supports. It also shows new devices available for pairing with your Xcode installation. Pair a device with Xcode to include them in the list of run destinations for your projects. To pair a device with a physical connection, connect the device to your Mac using an appropriate cable. Unlock the device and follow any instructions that appear in Xcode or on the device. To pair a device without a physical connection, such as visionOS and recent tvOS devices: Ensure that both your Mac and the device to connect are on the same Wi-Fi network. The Wi-Fi network must be compatible with Bonjour. Broadcast the device to the target Mac over the local network. To do this for a visionOS device, choose Settings > General > Remote Devices and for a tvOS device, choose Settings > Remotes and Devices > Remote App and Devices. Select the device from the list in the Devices and Simulators window in Xcode and click the pairing button which triggers a code to appear on the target device. Enter the code on the Mac to complete the pairing process. After pairing is complete, the device shows up under connected devices in Devices and Simulators window in Xcode. You don’t need to keep a paired device physically connected to your Mac to install and run apps. If your device is connected to Wi-Fi on the same network as your Mac, Xcode can use that connection to install and run your app. To pair an Apple Watch to a Mac, connect its companion iPhone to the Mac with a cable, and ensure that the iPhone is paired for development. After this step, follow any instructions on the Apple Watch to trust the Mac. When paired through an iPhone running iOS 17 or later, Xcode connects to the Apple Watch over Wi-Fi. Series 5 and older models of Apple Watch additionally require the Apple Watch and Mac to be associated with the same Bonjour-compatible Wi-Fi network. When paired through an iPhone running older versions of iOS, Xcode requires the iPhone to remain connected to the Mac in order to develop on any model of Apple Watch. Before installing your app, perform a few additional steps: Specify your Apple ID in the Account preferences in Xcode. Specify a valid team in your project’s Signing & Capabilities pane. Code sign your macOS app if it includes capabilities that require code signing; see Adding capabilities to your app. Register the device with your team if you belong to the Apple Developer Program. Enable Developer Mode on an iOS, watchOS, or visionOS device, as described in Enabling Developer Mode on a device. Note You don’t need to configure a Mac device to run your macOS apps. Similarly, to run the macOS version of an iPad app, choose My Mac (the Mac running Xcode) as the device. Click the Run button in the toolbar or choose Product > Run to build and run the app on the selected simulated or real device. View the status of the build in the activity area of the toolbar. If the build is successful, Xcode runs the app and opens a debugging session in the debug area. Use the controls in the debug area to step through your code, inspect variables, and interact with the debugger. If the build is unsuccessful, click the indicators in the activity area to read the error or warning messages in the Issue navigator. Alternatively, choose View > Navigators > Show Issue Navigator to view the messages. When you’re done testing the app, click the Stop button in the toolbar. If you choose a simulated device as the run destination, Simulator launches and displays a window that corresponds to the simulated environment. For some devices, Simulator surrounds the screen content with a shell that resembles the target device. In visionOS, it displays a synthetic space to mimic the experience someone would have when they wear the device. Each device shell and space has specific controls to support interactions. For device-specific details, see the reference on interactions.

Apps built specifically for visionOS adopt the standard system appearance, and they look more natural on the platform. Updating your app is also an opportunity to add elements that work well on the platform, such as 3D content and immersive experiences. In most cases, all you need to do to support visionOS is update your Xcode project’s settings and recompile your code. Depending on your app, you might need to make additional changes to account for features that are only found in the iOS SDK. While most of the same technologies are available on both platforms, some technologies don’t make sense or require hardware that isn’t present on visionOS devices. For example, people don’t typically use a headset to make contactless payments, so apps that that use the ProximityReader framework must disable those features when running in visionOS. Note If you use ARKit in your iOS app to create an augmented reality experience, you need to make additional changes to support ARKit in visionOS. For information on how to update this type of app, see Bringing your ARKit app to visionOS. The first step to updating your app is to add visionOS as a supported destination. In your project’s settings, select your app target and navigate to the General tab. In Supported Destinations, click the Add (+) button to add a new destination and select the Apple Vision option. Adding this option lets you build your app specifically for the visionOS SDK.  When you add Apple Vision as a destination, Xcode makes some one-time changes to your project’s build settings. After you add the destination, you can modify your project’s build settings and build phases to customize the build behavior specifically for visionOS. For example, you might remove dependencies for the visionOS version of your app, or change the set of source files you want to compile. For more information about how to update a target’s configuration, see Customizing the build phases of a target. Fix any deprecation warnings in the iOS version of your code before you build for visionOS. Apple marks APIs as deprecated when they are no longer relevant or a suitable replacement exists. When you compile code that calls deprecated APIs, the compiler generates warnings and often suggests replacements for you to use instead. visionOS removed many deprecated symbols entirely, turning these deprecation warnings into missing-symbol errors on the platform. Make changes in the iOS version of your app to see the original deprecation warning and replacement details. In addition to individual symbols, the following frameworks are deprecated in their entirety in both iOS and visionOS. If your app still uses these frameworks, stop using them immediately. The reference documentation for each framework includes information about how to update your code. Accounts Address Book Address Book UI Assets Library iAd Newsstand Kit NotificationCenter OpenGL ES The iOS SDK includes many frameworks that don’t apply to visionOS, either because they use hardware that isn’t available or their features don’t apply to the platform. Move code that uses these frameworks to separate source files whenever possible, and include those files only in the iOS version of your app. When you can’t isolate the code to separate source files, use conditional statements such as the ones below to offer a different code path for visionOS and iOS. When separating code for visionOS and iOS, understand that conditional checks for iOS also return true in visionOS, so place visionOS conditions first and execute the iOS code only if visionOS isn’t present. The following example shows how to configure conditional statements to execute separate code paths in visionOS and iOS: The following frameworks are available in the iOS SDK but not in the visionOS SDK.

To help you avoid using APIs for missing features, many frameworks offer APIs to check the availability of those features. Continue to use those APIs and take appropriate actions when the features aren’t available. In other cases, be prepared for the framework code to do nothing or to generate errors when you use it.

Use availability checks to determine when services are available. For additional information about how to isolate code to the iOS version of your app, see Running code on a specific platform or OS version. After your existing code runs correctly in visionOS, look for ways to improve the experience you offer on the platform. In visionOS, you can display content using more than just windows. Think about ways to incorporate the following elements into your interface: Depth. Many SwiftUI and UIKit views use visual effects to add depth. Look for similar ways to incorporate depth into your own custom views. 3D content. Think about where you might incorporate 3D models and shapes into your content. Use RealityKit to implement your content, and a RealityView to present that content from your app. See Adding 3D content to your app. Immersive experiences. Present a space to immerse someone in your app’s content. Spaces let you place content anywhere in a person’s surroundings. You can also create fully immersive experiences that display only your app’s content. See Creating fully immersive experiences in your app. Interactions with someone’s surroundings. Use ARKit to facilitate interactions between your content and the surroundings. For example, detect planar surfaces to use as anchor points for your content. See ARKit. If you built your interface using UIKit, you can still load iOS storyboards into your app, but you can’t customize your interface for visionOS or include 3D content. To include visionOS content in your app, programmatically add your SwiftUI views using UIHostingController or UIViewRepresentable. Alternatively, migrate the relevant parts of your interface to SwiftUI. Moving your interface to SwiftUI gives you less code to maintain and makes it easier to validate that your interface does what you want. For information about mixing SwiftUI and UIKit content, see UIKit integration in SwiftUI. For guidance on how best to incorporate depth and 3D elements in your interface, see Human Interface Guidelines. Add vector-based or high-resolution images to your project specifically to support visionOS. In visionOS, people can view your app’s content at different angles and different distances, so image pixels rarely line up with screen pixels. Vector-based images work best because they maintain their detail and crispness at any size. For bitmap-based images, use high-resolution images (@2x or better) to ensure your images retain detail at different sizes. For more information about designing images for your app, see Images in Human Interface Guidelines. In some cases, it might not make sense to port your app for visionOS. For example, don’t port the following types of apps: Apps that act as containers for app extensions. This includes apps where the primary purpose is to deliver custom keyboard extensions, device drivers, sticker packs, SMS and MMS message filtering extensions, call directory extensions, or widgets. Movement-based apps. This includes apps that follow a person’s location changes, such as apps that offer turn-by-turn directions or navigation. It also includes apps that track body movements. Selfie or photography apps. This includes apps where the primary purpose is to capture images or video from the device’s cameras. If your app uses an unsupported feature but can function without it, you can still bring your app to visionOS. Remove features that aren’t available and focus on bringing the rest of your content to the platform. For example, if you have an app that lets people write down notes and take pictures to include with those notes, disable the picture-taking ability in visionOS but let people add text and incorporate images they already have.

ARKit plays a crucial role in delivering your content to the display in iPadOS and iOS. In visionOS, you use ARKit only to acquire data about the person’s surroundings, and you do so using a different set of APIs. In visionOS, you don’t need a special view to display an augmented reality interface. Build windows with your app’s content using SwiftUI or UIKit. When you display those windows, visionOS places them in the person’s surroundings for you. If you want to control the placement of any 2D or 3D content in the person’s surroundings, build your content using SwiftUI and RealityKit. When migrating your app to visionOS, reuse as much of your app’s existing content as you can. visionOS supports most of the same technologies as iOS, so you can reuse project assets, 3D models, and most custom views. Don’t reuse your app’s ARKit code or any code that relies on technologies visionOS doesn’t support. For general guidance on how to port apps to visionOS, see Bringing your existing apps to visionOS. To create a single app that runs in both iOS and visionOS, use technologies that are available on both platforms. While ARKit in iOS lets you create your interface using several different technologies, the preferred technologies in visionOS are SwiftUI and RealityKit. If you’re not currently using RealityKit for 3D content, consider switching to it before you start adding visionOS support. If you retain code that uses older technologies in your iOS app, you might need to re-create much of that code using RealityKit when migrating to visionOS. If you use Metal to draw your app’s content, you can bring your code to visionOS to create content for 2D views or to create fully immersive experiences. You can’t use Metal to create 3D content that integrates with the person’s surroundings. This restriction prevents apps from sampling pixels of the person’s surroundings, which might contain sensitive information. For information on how to create a fully immersive experience with Metal, see Drawing fully immersive content using Metal. The recommended format for 3D assets in iOS and visionOS is USDZ. This format offers a compact single file for everything, including your models, textures, behaviors, physics, anchoring, and more. If you have assets that don’t use this format, use the Reality Converter tool that comes with Xcode to convert them for your project. When building 3D scenes for visionOS, use Reality Composer Pro to create your scenes that incorporate your USDZ assets. With Reality Composer Pro, you can import your USD files and edit them in place, nondestructively. If your iOS app applies custom materials to your assets, convert those materials to shader graphs in the app. Although you can bring models and materials to your project using USDZ files, you can’t bring custom shaders you wrote using Metal. Replace any custom shader code with MaterialX shaders. Many digital content creation tools support the MaterialX standard, and let you create dynamic shaders and save them with your USDZ files. Reality Composer Pro and RealityKit support MaterialX shaders, and incorporate them with your other USDZ asset content. For more information about MaterialX, see https://materialx.org. In visionOS, you manage your app’s content, and the system handles the integration of that content with the person’s surroundings. This approach differs from iOS, where you use a special ARKit view to blend your content and the live camera content. Bringing your interface to visionOS therefore means you need to remove this special ARKit view and focus only on your content. If you can display your app’s content using SwiftUI or UIKit views, build a window with those views and present it from your visionOS app. If you use other technologies to incorporate 2D or 3D content into the person’s surroundings, make the following substitutions in the visionOS version of your app. If you create your AR experience using: Update to: RealityKit and ARView RealityKit and RealityView SceneKit and ARSCNView RealityKit and RealityView SpriteKit and ARSKView RealityKit or SwiftUI A RealityView is a SwiftUI view that manages the content and animations you create using RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro. You can add a RealityView to any of your app’s windows to display 2D or 3D content. You can also add the view to an doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/swiftui/immersivespace scene, which you use to integrate your RealityKit content into the person’s surroundings. Note You can load iOS storyboards into a visionOS app, but you can’t customize your interface for visionOS or include 3D content. If you want to share interface files between iOS and visionOS, adopt SwiftUI views or create your interface programmatically. For more information about how to use RealityView and respond to interactions with your content, see Adding 3D content to your app. ARKit provides different APIs for iOS and visionOS, and the way you use ARKit services on the platforms is also different. In iOS, you must use ARKit to put your content onscreen, and you can also use it to manage interactions between your content and a person’s surroundings. In visionOS, the system puts your content onscreen, so you only use ARKit to manage interactions with the surroundings. Because of this more limited usage, some apps don’t need ARKit at all in visionOS. The only time you use ARKit in visionOS is when you need one of the following services: Plane detection Image tracking Scene reconstruction Hand tracking World tracking and device-pose prediction Use plane detection, image tracking, and scene reconstruction to facilitate interactions between your app’s virtual content and real-world items. For example, use plane detection to detect a tabletop on which to place your content. Use world tracking to record anchors that you want to persist between launches of your app. Use hand tracking if your app requires custom hands-based input. To start ARKit services in your app, create an ARKitSession object and run it with the data providers for each service. Unlike ARKit in iOS, services in visionOS are independent of one another, and you can start and stop each one at any time. The following example shows how to detect horizontal and vertical planes. Data providers deliver new information using an asynchronous sequence. If you use the world-tracking data provider in visionOS, ARKit automatically persists the anchors you add to your app’s content. You don’t need to persist these anchors yourself. For more information about how to use ARKit, see ARKit. If your app uses ARKit features that aren’t present in visionOS, isolate that code to the iOS version of your app. The following features are available in iOS, but don’t have an equivalent in visionOS: Face tracking Body tracking Geotracking and placing anchors using a latitude and longitude Object detection App Clip Code detection Video frame post-processing Although whole body tracking isn’t available in visionOS, you can track the hands of the person wearing the device. Hand gestures are an important way of interacting with content in visionOS. SwiftUI handles common types of interactions like taps and drags, but you can use custom hand tracking for more complex gestures your app supports. If you use ARKit raycasting in iOS to detect interactions with objects in the person’s surroundings, you might not need that code in visionOS. SwiftUI and RealityKit handle both direct and indirect interactions with your app’s content in 3D space, eliminating the need for raycasting in many situations. In other situations, you can use the features of ARKit and RealityKit to manage interactions with your content. For example, you might use ARKit hand tracking to determine where someone is pointing in the scene, and use scene reconstruction to build a mesh you can integrate into your RealityKit content.

Features like volumes and immersive spaces let you put interactive virtual objects into people’s environments, or put people into a virtual environment. Hello World uses these tools to teach people about the Earth — the planet we call home. The app shows how the Earth’s tilt creates the seasons, how objects move as they orbit the Earth, and how Earth appears from space. The app uses SwiftUI to define its interface, including both 2D and 3D elements. To create, customize, and manage 3D models and effects, it also relies on the RealityKit framework and Reality Composer Pro. Hello World constructs the scene that it displays at launch — the first scene that appears in the WorldApp structure — using a WindowGroup: Like other platforms — for example, macOS and iOS — visionOS displays a window group as a familiar-looking window. In visionOS, people can resize and move windows around the Shared Space. Even if your app offers a sophisticated 3D experience, a window is a great starting point for an app because it eases people into the experience. It’s also a good place to provide instructions or controls. Tip This particular window group uses the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/WindowStyle/plain window style to maintain control over the glass background effect that visionOS would otherwise automatically add. After you watch a brief introductory animation that shows the text Hello World typing in, the Modules view that defines the primary scene’s content presents options to explore different aspects of the world. This view contains a table of contents at the root of a NavigationStack: A visionOS navigation stack has the same behavior that it has in other platforms. When it first appears, the stack displays its root view. When someone chooses an embedded NavigationLink, the stack draws a new view and displays a back button in the toolbar. When someone taps the back button, the stack restores the previous view.  The trailing closure of the navigationDestination(for:destination:) view modifier in the code above displays a view when someone activates a link based on a module input that comes from the corresponding link’s initializer: The possible module values come from a custom Module enumeration: The globe module opens with a few facts about the Earth in the main window next to a decorative, flat image that supports the content. To help people understand even more, the module includes a button titled View Globe that opens a 3D interactive globe in a new window.  To be able to open multiple scene types, Hello World includes the UIApplicationSceneManifest key in its Information Property List file. The value for this key is a dictionary that includes the UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes key with a value of true: With the key in place, the app makes use of a second WindowGroup in its App declaration. This new window group uses the Globe view as its content: This window group creates a window that has arbitrary depth — great for displaying a 3D model in a bounded region that behaves like a transparent box — because Hello World uses the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/WindowStyle/volumetric window style scene modifier. People can move this box around the Shared Space like any other window, and the content remains fixed inside. The doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/Scene/defaultSize(width:height:depth:in:) modifier specifies a size for the window in meters, including a depth dimension. The Globe view contains 3D content, but is still just a SwiftUI view. It contains two elements in a ZStack: a subview that draws a model of the Earth, and another that provides a control panel that people can use to configure the model’s appearance. The globe module presents a View Globe button that people can tap to display the volumetric window or dismiss the window, depending on the current state. Hello World achieves this behavior by creating a Toggle with the button style, and embedding it in a custom, reusable WindowToggle view.  When someone taps the toggle, the isShowing state changes, and the onChange(of:initial:_:) modifier calls the openWindow or dismissWindow action to open or dismiss the window, respectively. The view gets these actions from the environment and uses an identifier that matches the window’s identifier. You use windows in visionOS the same way you do in other platforms. But windows in visionOS provide a small amount of depth you can use to create 3D effects — like elements that appear in front of other elements. Hello World takes advantage of this depth to present small models inline with 2D content. The app’s second module, Objects in Orbit, provides information about objects that go around the Earth, like the Moon and artificial satellites. To give a sense of what these objects look like, the module displays 3D models of these items directly inside the window.  Hello World loads these models from the asset bundle using a Model3D structure inside a custom ItemView. The view scales and positions the model to fit the available space, and applies optional orientation adjustments: The app uses this ItemView once for each model, placing each in an overlay that only becomes visible based on the current selection. For example, the following overlay displays the satellite model with a small amount of tilt in the x-axis and z-axis: The VStack that contains the models also contains a Picker that people use to select a model to view: When you add 3D effects to a 2D window, keep this guidance in mind: Don’t overdo it. These kinds of effects add interest, but can unintentionally obscure important controls or information as people view the window from different directions. Ensure that elements don’t exceed the available depth. Excess depth causes elements to clip. Account for any position or orientation changes that might occur after initial placement. Avoid models intersecting with the backing glass. Again, account for potential movement after initial placement. People can visualize how satellites move around the Earth because the app’s orbit module displays the Earth, the Moon, and a communications satellite together as a single system. People can move the system anywhere in their environment or resize it using standard gestures. They can also move themselves around the system to get different perspectives.  Note To learn about designing with gestures in visionOS, read Gestures in Human Interface Guidelines. To create this visualization, the app displays the Orbit view — which contains a single RealityView that models the entire system — in an doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersiveSpace scene with the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle/mixed immersion style: As with any secondary scene in a visionOS app, this scene depends on having the UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes key in the Information Property List file. The app also opens and closes the space using a generalized toggle view that resembles the one used for windows: There are a few key differences from the window equivalent of this toggle that appears in the section Open and dismiss the globe window: SpaceToggle uses doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/openImmersiveSpace and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/dismissImmersiveSpace from the environment, rather than the window equivalents. The dismiss action in this case doesn’t require an identifier, because people can only open one space at a time, even across apps. The open and dismiss actions for spaces operate asynchronously, and so they appear inside a Task. The app’s final module gives people a sense of the Earth’s place in the solar system. Like other modules, this one includes information and a decorative image next to a button that leads to another visualization — in this case so people can experience Earth from space. When a person taps the button, the app takes over the entire display and shows stars in all directions, which you can see in the video at the right. The Earth appears directly in front, the Moon to the right, and the Sun to the left. The main window also shows a small control panel that people can use to exit the fully immersive experience.  Tip People can exit full immersion by pressing the device’s Digital Crown, but it’s typically useful when you provide a built-in mechanism to maintain control of the experience within your app. The app uses another immersive space scene for this module, but here with the doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/ImmersionStyle/full immersion style that turns off the passthrough video: This scene depends on the same UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes key that other secondary scenes do, and is activated by the same custom SpaceToggle that the previous section describes, but uses the Module.solar.id scene identifier in this case. To reuse the main window for the solar system controls, Hello World places both the navigation stack and the controls in a ZStack, and then sets the opacity of each to ensure that only one appears at a time:       Don’t overdo it. These kinds of effects add interest, but can unintentionally obscure important controls or information as people view the window from different directions.
Ensure that elements don’t exceed the available depth. Excess depth causes elements to clip. Account for any position or orientation changes that might occur after initial placement.
Avoid models intersecting with the backing glass. Again, account for potential movement after initial placement. SpaceToggle uses doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/openImmersiveSpace and doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/SwiftUI/EnvironmentValues/dismissImmersiveSpace from the environment, rather than the window equivalents.
The dismiss action in this case doesn’t require an identifier, because people can only open one space at a time, even across apps.
The open and dismiss actions for spaces operate asynchronously, and so they appear inside a Task. WorldApp WindowGroup WindowGroup(""Hello World"", id: ""modules"") {

People get a familiar media-browsing experience navigating the libraryʼs content and playing videos they find interesting. The app provides a similar experience on supported platforms, but leverages unique features of visionOS to create a novel, immersive playback experience. When you select a video in the library, Destination Video presents a view that displays additional details about the item. The view presents controls to play the video and specify whether to include it in your Up Next list. In visionOS, it also displays a video poster along its leading edge. Tapping the view’s Preview button displays an inline preview of the video. When you present an AVPlayerViewController object’s interface as a child of another view, inline controls display, for example, pause, skip, and seek. Showing standard playback controls in your app provides a familiar UI that automatically adapts its appearance to fit each platform, and is the recommended choice in most cases. Destination Video uses a simple UI for the inline player view: a single button that toggles state of playback, and replays the content when it reaches the item’s end. AVPlayerViewController doesn’t provide this controls style, but the app uses it to display the video content without controls by setting the value of its showsPlaybackControls property to false. It then overlays the custom playback controls it requires. See the Destination Video’s InlinePlayerView type for details on how you can implement this. Note AVPlayerViewController only supports displaying 2D content when embedded inline. Present the player fullscreen to play 3D video. One of the most exciting features of visionOS is its ability to play 3D video along with spatial audio, which adds a deeper level of immersion to the viewing experience. Playing 3D content in your app requires that you display AVPlayerViewController in its full screen presentation. When you present the player fullscreen, the system automatically docks it into the ideal viewing position, and presents streamlined playback controls that keep the person’s focus on the content. Note In iOS or tvOS, you typically present video in a full-screen presentation using the fullScreenCover(isPresented:onDismiss:content:) modifier. You can present the player this way in visionOS, but the recommended way to present it fullscreen is to set it as the root view of your app’s window group. Destination Video’s ContentView displays the library view by default. It observes changes to the player model’s presentation property, which indicates whether the app requests inline or fullscreen playback. When the presentation state changes to fullScreen, the view redraws the UI to display the player view in place of the library: When someone selects the Play Video button on the detail screen, this calls the player model’s loadVideo(_: presentation:) method requesting the fullScreen presentation option: After the player model successfully loads the video content for playback, it updates its presentation value to fullScreen, which causes the app to replace the library with PlayerView. To dismiss the fullscreen player in visionOS, people tap the back button in the player UI. To handle this action, the app’s FullScreenPlayerView type defines an AVPlayerViewControllerDelegate object that handles the dismissal: When the delegate receives this call, it clears the media from the player model and resets the presentation state back to its default value, which results in the Destination Video app redisplaying the library view. Media playback apps require common configuration of their capabilities and audio session. In addition to performing the steps outlined in Configuring your app for media playback, Destination Video also adopts new AVAudioSession API to customize the a person’s spatial audio experience. After the app successfully loads a video for playback, it configures the spatial audio experience for the current presentation. For the inline player view, it sets the experience to a small front-focused sound stage where the audio comes from a person’s perception of front. When displaying a video full screen, it specifies automatic settings that let the system optimize the experience to best fit the video presentation. Building video playback apps for visionOS provides new opportunities to enhance the viewing experience beyond the bounds of the player window. To add a greater level of immersion, the sample presents an immersive space that displays a scene around a person as they watch the video. It defines the immersive space in the DestinationVideo app structure: The immersive space presents an instance of DestinationView, which maps a texture to the inside of a sphere that it displays around a person. The app presents it using the .progressive immersion style, which lets someone change their amount of immersion by turning the Digital Crown on the device. The Destination Video app automatically presents the immersive space when a person navigates to a video’s detail view, and dismisses it when they return to the library. To monitor these events, the app observes its navigation path to determine when a navigation event occurs so it can show or dismiss the space: One of the best ways to enhance your app’s playback experience is to make that experience shareable with others. You can use the AVFoundation and the GroupActivities frameworks to build SharePlay experiences that bring people together even when they can’t be in the same location. The Destination Video app creates an experience where people can watch videos with others across devices and platforms. It defines a group activity called VideoWatchingActivity that adopts the GroupActivity protocol. When people have a FaceTime call active and they play a video in the fullscreen player, it becomes eligible for playback for everyone on the call. The app’s VideoWatchingCoordinator actor manages Destination Video’s SharePlay functionality. It observes the activation of new VideoWatchingActivity sessions and when one starts, it sets the GroupSession instance on the player object’s AVPlaybackCoordinator: With the player configured to use the group session, when the app loads new videos, they become eligible to share with people in the FaceTime call.

In addition to helping you compose entity hierarchies, Reality Composer Pro also gives you the ability to add and configure components — even custom components that you’ve written — to the entities in your scenes. You can also design the visual appearance of entities using Shader Graph, a node-based visual tool for creating RealityKit materials. Shader Graph gives you a tremendous amount of control over the surface details and shape of entities. You can even create animated materials and dynamic materials that change based on the state of your app or user input. Diorama demonstrates many of RealityKit and Reality Composer Pro’s features. It displays an interactive, virtual topographical trail map, much like the real-world dioramas you find at trailheads and ranger stations in national parks. This virtual map has points of interest you can tap to bring up more detailed information. You can also smoothly transition between two trail maps: Yosemite and Catalina Island. Your Reality Composer Pro project must contain assets, which you use to compose scenes for your app. Diorama’s project has several assets, including 3D models like the diorama table, trail map, some birds and clouds that fly over the map, and a number of sounds and images. Reality Composer Pro provides a library of 3D models you can use. Access the library by clicking the Add (+) button on the right side of the toolbar. Selecting objects from the library imports them into your project.  Diorama uses custom assets instead of the available library assets. To use custom assets in your own Reality Composer Pro scenes, import them into your project in one of three ways: by dragging them to Reality Composer Pro’s project browser, using File > Import from the File menu, or copying the assets into the .rkassets bundle inside your project’s Swift package.  Note Although you can still load USDZ files and other assets directly in visionOS, RealityKit compiles assets in your Reality Composer Pro project into a binary format that loads considerably faster than loading from individual files. A single Reality Composer Pro project can have multiple scenes. A scene is an entity hierarchy stored in the project as a .usda file that you can load and display in a RealityView. You can use Reality Composer’s scenes to build an entire RealityKit scene, or to store reusable entity hierarchies that you can use as building block for composing scenes at runtime — the approach Diorama uses. You can add as many different scenes to your project as you need by selecting File > New > Scene, or pressing ⌘N. At the top of the Reality Composer Pro window, there’s a separate tab for every scene that’s currently open. To open a scene, double-click the scene’s .usda file in the project browser. To edit a scene, select its tab, and make changes using the hierarchy viewer, the 3D view, and the inspector.  RealityKit can only include entities in a scene, but it can’t use every type of asset that Reality Composer Pro supports as an entity. Reality Composer Pro automatically turns some assets, like 3D models, into an entity when you place them in a scene. It uses other assets indirectly. It uses image files, for example, primarily to define the surface details of model entities. Diorama uses multiple scenes to group assets together and then, at runtime, combines those scenes into a single immersive experience. For example, the diorama table has its own scene that includes the table, the map surface, and the trail lines. There are separate scenes for the birds that flock over the table, and for the clouds that float above it.  To add entities to a scene, drag assets from the project browser to the scene’s hierarchy view or 3D view. If the asset you drag is a type that can be represented as an entity, Reality Composer Pro adds it to your scene. You can select any asset in the scene hierarchy or the 3D view and change its location, rotation, and scale using the inspector on the right side of the window or the manipulator in the 3D view. RealityKit follows a design pattern called Entity Component System (ECS). In an ECS app, you store additional data on an entity using components and can implement entity behavior by writing systems that use the data from those components. You can add and configure components to entities in Reality Composer Pro, including both shipped components like PhysicsBodyComponent, and custom components that you write and place in the Sources folder of your Reality Composer Pro Swift package. You can even create new components in Reality Composer Pro and then edit them in Xcode. For more information about ECS, see Understanding RealityKit’s modular architecture. Diorama uses custom components to identify which transforms are points of interest, to mark the birds so the app can make sure they flock together, and to control the opacity of entities that are specific to just one of the two maps. To add a component to an entity, select that entity in the hierarchy view or 3D view. At the bottom right of the inspector window, click on the Add Component button. A list of available components appears and the first item in that list is New Component. This item creates a new component class, and optionally a new system class, and adds the component to the selected entity. If you look at the list of components, you see the PointOfInterestComponent that Diorama uses to indicate which transforms are points of interest. If the selected entity doesn’t already contain a PointOfInterestComponent, selecting that adds it to the selected entity. Each entity can only have one component of a specific type. You can edit the values of the existing component in the inspector, which changes what shows up when you tap that point of interest in the app.  In Reality Composer Pro, a transform is an empty entity that marks a point in space. A transform contains a location, rotation, and scale, and its child entities inherit those. But, transforms have no visual representation and do nothing by themselves. Use transforms to mark locations in your scene or organize your entity hierarchy. For example, you might make several entities that need to move together into child entities of the same transform, so you can move them together by moving the parent transform. Diorama uses transforms with a PointOfInterestComponent to indicate points of interest on the map. When the app runs, those transforms mark the location of the floating placards with the name of the location. Tapping on a placard expands it to show more detailed information. To turn transforms into an interactive view, the app looks for a specific component on transforms called a PointOfInterestComponent. Because a transform contains no data other than location, orientation, and scale, it uses this component to hold the data the app needs to display on the placards. If you open the DioramaAssembled scene in Reality Composer Pro and click on the transform called Cathedral_Rocks, you see the PointOfInterestComponent in the inspector.  To load a Reality Composer Pro scene, use load(named:in:), passing the name of the scene you want to load and the project’s bundle. Reality Composer Pro Swift packages define a constant that provides ready access to its bundle. The constant is the name of the Reality Composer Pro project with “Bundle” appended to the end. In this case, the project is called RealityKitContent, so the constant is called RealityKitContentBundle. Here’s how Diorama loads the map table in the RealityView initializer: The load(named:in:) function is asynchronous when called from an asynchronous context. Because the content closure of the RealityView initializer is asynchronous, it automatically uses the async version to load the scene. Note that when using it asynchronously, you must call it using the await keyword. Diorama adds a PointOfInterestComponent to a transform to display details about interesting places. Every point of interest’s name appears in a view that floats above its location on the map. When you tap the floating view, it expands to show detailed information, which the app pulls from the PointOfInterestComponent. The app shows these details by creating a SwiftUI view for each point of interest and querying for all entities that have a PointOfInterestComponent using this query declared in ImmersiveView.swift: In the RealityView initializer, Diorama queries to retrieve the points of interest entities and passes them to a function called createLearnMoreView(for:), which creates the view and saves it for display when it’s tapped. Diorama displays the information added to a PointOfInterestComponent in a LearnMoreView, which it stores as an attachment. Attachments are SwiftUI views that are also RealityKit entities and that you can place into a RealityKit scene at a specific location. Diorama uses attachments to position the view that floats above each point of interest. The app first checks to see if the entity has a component called PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent. If it doesn’t, it creates a new one and adds it to the entity. This new component contains a value you only use at runtime that you don’t need to edit in Reality Composer Pro. By putting this value into a separate component and adding it to entities at runtime, Reality Composer Pro never displays it in the inspector. The PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent stores an identifier called an attachment tag, which uniquely identifies an attachment so the app can retrieve and display it at the appropriate time. Next, Diorama creates a SwiftUI view called a LearnMoreView with the information from the PointOfInterestComponent, tags that view, and stores the tag in the PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent. Finally, it stores the view in an AttachmentProvider, which is a custom class that maintains references to the attachment views so they don’t get deallocated when they’re not in a scene. Assigning a view to an attachment provider doesn’t actually display that view in the scene. The initializer for RealityView has an optional view builder called attachments that’s used to specify the attachments. In the update closure of the initializer, which RealityKit calls when the contents of the view change, the app queries for entities with a PointOfInterestRuntimeComponent, uses the tag from that component to retrieve the correct attachment for it, and then adds that attachment and places it above its location on the map. To switch between the two different topographical maps, Diorama shows a slider that morphs the map between the two locations. To accomplish this, and to draw elevation lines on the map, the FlatTerrain entity in the DioramaAssembled scene uses a Shader Graph material. Shader Graph is a node-based material editor that’s built into Reality Composer Pro. Shader Graph gives you the ability to create dynamic materials that you can change at runtime. Prior to Reality Composer Pro, the only way to implement a dynamic material like this was to create a CustomMaterial and write Metal shaders to implement the necessary logic. Diorama’s DynamicTerrainMaterialEnhanced does two things. It draws contour lines on the map based on height data stored in displacement map images, and it also offsets the vertices of the flat disk based on the same data. By interpolating between two different height maps, the app achieves a smooth transition between the two different sets of height data. When you build Shader Graph materials, you can give them input parameters called promoted inputs that you set from Swift code. This allows you to implement logic that previously required writing a Metal shader. The materials you build in the editor can affect both the look of an entity using the custom surface output node, which equates to writing Metal code in a fragment shader, or the position of vertices using the geometry modifier output, which equates to Metal code running in a vertex shader.  Node graphs can contain subgraphs, which are similar to functions. They contain reusable sets of nodes with inputs and outputs. Subgraphs contain the logic to draw the contour lines and the logic to offset the vertices. Double-click a subgraph to edit it. For more information about building materials using Shader Graph, see Explore Materials in Reality Composer Pro. To change the map, DynamicTerrainMaterialEnhanced has a promoted input called Progress. If that parameter is set to 1.0, it displays Catalina Island. If it’s set to 0, it displays Yosemite. Any other number shows a state in transition between the two. When someone manipulates the slider, the app updates that input parameter based on the slider’s value. Important Shader Graph material parameters are case-sensitive. If the capitalization is wrong, your code won’t actually update the material. The app sets the value of the input parameter in a function called handleMaterial() that the slider’s .onChanged closure calls. That function retrieves the ShaderGraphMaterial from the terrain entity and calls setParameter(name:value:) on it.       .rkassets .usda RealityView .usda PhysicsBodyComponent PointOfInterestComponent PointOfInterestComponent PointOfInterestComponent PointOfInterestComponent DioramaAssembled Cathedral_Rocks PointOfInterestComponent load(named:in:) RealityKitContent RealityKitContentBundle RealityView let entity = try await Entity.load(named: ""DioramaAssembled"",

} Happy Beam  Overview Design the game interface in SwiftUI Detect a heart gesture with ARKit Support several kinds of input Display 3D content with RealityKit Add SharePlay support for multiplayer gaming experiences See Also       Related samples Related articles Related videos                                In visionOS, you can create fun, dynamic games and apps using several different frameworks to create new kinds of spatial experiences: RealityKit, ARKit, SwiftUI, and Group Activities. This sample introduces Happy Beam, a game where you and your friends can hop on a FaceTime call and play together. You’ll learn the mechanics of the game where grumpy clouds float around in the space, and people play by making a heart shape with their hands to project a beam. People aim the beam at the clouds to cheer them up, and a score counter keeps track of how well each player does cheering up the clouds. Most apps in visionOS launch as a window that opens different scene types depending on the needs of the app. Here you see how Happy Beam presents a fun interface to people by using several SwiftUI views that display a welcome screen, a coaching screen that gives instructions, a scoreboard, and a game-ending screen.     The following shows you the primary view in the app that displays each phase of gameplay: When 3D content starts to appear, the game opens an immersive space to present content outside of the main window and in a person’s surroundings. The HappyBeam container view declares a dependency on openImmersiveSpace: It later uses that dependency to open the space from the app’s declaration when it’s time to start showing 3D content: The Happy Beam app recognizes the central heart-shaped hands gesture using ARKit’s support for 3D hand tracking in visionOS. Using hand tracking requires a running session and authorization from the wearer. It uses the NSHandsTrackingUsageDescription user info key to explain to players why the app requests permission for hand tracking.  Hand-tracking data isn’t available when your app is only displaying a window or volume. Instead, it’s available when you present an immersive space, as in the previous example. You can detect gestures using ARKit data with a level of accuracy that depends on your use case and intended experience. For example, Happy Beam could require strict positioning of finger joints to closely resemble a heart shape. Instead, however, it prompts people to make a heart shape and uses a heuristic to indicate when the gesture is close enough. The following checks whether a person’s thumbs and index fingers are almost touching: To support accessibility features and general user preferences, include multiple kinds of input in an app that uses hand tracking as one form of input. Happy Beam supports several kinds of input: Interactive hands input from ARKit with the custom heart gesture. Drag gesture input to rotate the stationary beam on its platform. Accessibility components from RealityKit to support custom actions for cheering up the clouds. Game Controller support to make control over the beam more interactive from Switch Control. The 3D content in the app comes in the form of assets that you can export from Reality Composer Pro. You place each asset in the RealityView that represents your immersive space. The following shows how Happy Beam generates clouds when the game starts, as well as materials for the floor-based beam projector. Because the game uses collision detection to keep score — the beam cheers up grumpy clouds when they collide — you make collision shapes for each model that might be involved. You use the Group Activities framework in visionOS to support interactive experiences in a shared activity during a FaceTime call. Happy Beam uses Group Activities to sync the score, active players list, and the position of each player’s projected beam. Use a reliable channel to send information that’s important to be correct, even if it can be slightly delayed as a result. The following shows how Happy Beam updates the game model’s score state in response to a score message: Use an unreliable messenger for sending data with low-latency requirements. Because the delivery mode is unreliable, some messages might not make it. Happy Beam uses the unreliable mode to send live updates to the position of the beam when each participant in the call chooses the Spatial option in FaceTime. The following shows how Happy Beam serializes beam data for each message:        struct HappyBeam: View {
